"Find Your Way to Oz" is a Google Chrome Experiment brought to the web by
Disney. It allows you to take an interactive journey through a Kansas circus,
which leads you to the land of Oz after you are swept up by a massive storm.

In this project our goal was to combine the richness of cinema with the
technical capabilities of the browser to create a fun, immersive experience
that users can form a strong connection with. But it was important to
complement Sam Raimi’s vision for Oz. He has spent five years carefully
constructing a world for this story to live in. Our interactive journey would
have to live in the same space, and yet could not cover the same ground. In
other words, we needed a simple interactive journey that flows towards the
world Mr. Raimi was creating on film. That is where the key phrase “Find Your
Way To Oz” came in. This was going to be your journey to Oz.

The project is a massive collaborative effort between UNIT9, the Google
Chrome's Team and Disney, it was brought to life thanks to the powerful Chrome
renderer, making it possible to output a cheerful carnival scene in WebGL
along side an ominous storm tornado with GLSL Shaders. The user is immersed in
a 3D sound environment, which changes according to the areas the user is
exploring. The WebGL environment is combined with the latest CSS3 features;
with animated DOM elements using CSS3 transitions. Last but not least, the
user is invited to take his own picture or record his own movie using the new
getUserMedia API (WebRTC).
