Sing at the microphone, draw your avatar, watch your avatar sing your recording, then share your masterpiece on Facebook or download it on your
mobile phone.

This project was a very entertaining challenge, we had 3 main goals:

1. Let the user draw his personalized avatar
2. Let the user sing at the microphone his favorite song
3. Connect the avatar with the singing performance in order to create a singing avatar which would be shared by the user

All of this was done using Flash technologies; the site also used an unique design style where all sections where on-screen physical pages which were hand-drawn on-the-fly.
