Every week each American uses enough water to fill a 40ft pool. This water
doesn’t come from the faucet, but the Colorado River. A river whose rapid
surge of fresh water once flowed down the heart of the gulf coast, but doesn’t
even reach the gulf of California anymore.

By building a parallax html5 microsite experience for desktop, the aim was
simple: to raise awareness about water consumption throughout the USA, and
specifically, the conditions of the Colorado River. Users are given the
opportunity to pledge to help save the Colorado River. Participants are able
to scroll through the whimsical illustrations influenced by info graphic
styles along the Colorado river, pledging at any given point, their commitment
to help rebuild one of USA’s most important water ways.

After a user pledges, their Facebook profile image will appear along the river
at the point at which they joined. Scrolling down the river they can then see
all the different people who are part of the experience.
