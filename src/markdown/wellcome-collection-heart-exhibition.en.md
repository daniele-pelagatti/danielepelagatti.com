Explore the [Wellcome](http://www.wellcomecollection.org/) exhibition, navigate the collection via semantically connected keywords and dig inside endless layers of information. 

This website uses a highly experimental navigation metaphor.

Drag around your point of view, click on _hotspots_ , read information, then
continue exploring linked resources or turn back and discover new landscapes.

This interactive experience was made possible thanks to unit9 home-brew 3D
engine _Tanuki 3D_.
