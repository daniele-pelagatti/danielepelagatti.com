Test your mental performance and make "Brains" dance using your web-cam. 

A challenging project where pure R&D, design and dance choreography are all
mixed together in order to deliver an innovative, feature-rich, web experience. 

Unit9 Italy developed the _Web-cam Motion Detection Engine_ from scratch trying to reach the balance between the requirements of precision, sensitivity and speed of response: a difficult task as these factors usually tug in opposite directions! 

The result is an entertaining game where the user is dragged into a lively dance in front of his monitor, splashing water bubbles and trying to avoid obstacles. An unique show if you are watching from a few steps away. [SWFAddress](http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/) is used for deep-linking and page navigation.
