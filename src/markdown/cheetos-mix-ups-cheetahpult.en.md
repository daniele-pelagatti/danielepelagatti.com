Found only on YouTube, Cheetahpult is the first of its kind to be developed; a
game/brand integration within a YouTube platform, where the users play through
the YouTube site.

Cheetahpult allows players to experience a totally new game play style based
on a hybrid 3D engine which allows an unseen-before realism.

The game also offers live-action visuals where players can connect to with
their smartphone or using their mouse to use as a controller to launch an
array of mix-up Cheetos.
