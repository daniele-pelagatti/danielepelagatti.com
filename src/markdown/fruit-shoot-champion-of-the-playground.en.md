BBH reached out to unit9 to collaborate on the creation of a site for children
aged 6-12, that serves as both a social networking and gaming site.

Social interaction and playing games are what the playground is all about â€“
_Champion of the Playground for Fruit Shoot_ presents kids with a number of
challenges, from playing fun and challenging webcam games, to engaging with
other players and watching and commenting on videos.
